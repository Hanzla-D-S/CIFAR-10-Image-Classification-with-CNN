# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN

This project builds a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow/Keras** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset** into 10 categories:  
*airplane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck*.

## Steps
- **Dataset Loading & Normalization:** Importing CIFAR-10 and scaling pixel values  
- **Data Visualization:** Displaying sample training images with labels  
- **Model Building:** Creating a CNN with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers  
- **Training:** Using Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss  
- **Performance Tracking:** Plotting training vs validation accuracy across epochs  
- **Evaluation:** Measuring final accuracy on the test set
